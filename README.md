Built over 36 hours during ShellHacks 2025 in Miami, FL, NextMove transforms hours of scattered research into one comprehensive search. Our web application leverages 4 parallel AI agents to consolidate everything you need to relocate with confidence‚Äîall in one place.

## üéØ What It Does

**Stop juggling dozens of websites and spreadsheets.** NextMove provides a one-stop shop for your entire relocation journey through four specialized AI agents working simultaneously:

- **Financial Agent**: Calculates upfront moving costs (first month's rent, security deposit, moving expenses) and recommends a sensible monthly rent budget based on the 30% rule
- **Career Agent**: Discovers job opportunities in your target city that match your qualifications and career goals
- **Lifestyle Agent**: Identifies best-fit neighborhoods based on your interests, lifestyle preferences, and priorities
- **Housing Agent**: Finds apartments that meet your requirements in your preferred areas

**What typically takes hours of research across multiple platforms‚Äîbudgeting calculators, job boards, neighborhood reviews, apartment listings‚ÄîNextMove delivers in a single, comprehensive search.**
